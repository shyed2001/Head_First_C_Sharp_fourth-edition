/* What are namespaces? 
 * Namespaces in C# are like containers or organizers for your code. They help you group related classes, interfaces, and other code elements together. This organization makes your code easier to manage, especially in large projects.

Why use namespaces?

To avoid naming conflicts: You can have classes with the same name in different namespaces.
To organize code: It helps structure your project logically.
To control access: It provides a way to control the scope and visibility of your code elements.
How namespaces work:

They create a "scope" for the names of the things inside them.
You can have nested namespaces (namespaces inside namespaces).
The "using" keyword allows you to use elements from a namespace without fully qualifying their names.
*/

/* Real-world analogy of namespaces:
Think of a namespace as a library. Inside this library, you have different shelves (nested namespaces) for different subjects. On each shelf, you have books (classes). The library's organization helps you find the book you need quickly.

In the MatchGame example:
namespace MatchGame
{
    // Game code here...
}
This puts all the code for the match game into a container called "MatchGame". If someone else wants to use your game in their project, they can refer to it as MatchGame.MainWindow for example, avoiding conflicts with any other MainWindow classes they might have.

Best practices:

Name namespaces clearly and descriptively.
Use PascalCase for namespace names (e.g., System.Collections, not system.collections).
Organize namespaces to reflect the structure of your project.
Use nested namespaces for further organization when needed.

/* Functions:

Definition: A function is a self-contained block of code that performs a specific task.
Characteristics:

It has a name.
It can take inputs (parameters).
It can return a value (or be void if it doesn't return anything).
It can be called and reused multiple times.


Purpose: Functions help organize code, promote reusability, and break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.
In C#, standalone functions are typically static methods within a class.
 
 */

/*Classes:

Definition: A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It encapsulates data and behavior into a single unit.
Characteristics:

It can have properties (data) and methods (behavior).
It serves as a custom data type.
It supports object-oriented programming concepts like inheritance and polymorphism.


Purpose: Classes help organize code, model real-world entities or concepts, and provide a way to create reusable and modular code.
In C#, everything is part of a class (or similar constructs like structs or records).
 
 */

/*Methods:

Definition: A method is a function that belongs to a class or object.
Characteristics:

It defines the behavior of objects created from the class.
It can access and manipulate the object's data (properties).
It can be public, private, or protected, controlling access from outside the class.
It can be static (belonging to the class itself) or instance (belonging to objects of the class).


Purpose: Methods encapsulate behavior within a class, allowing objects to perform actions or computations.
In C#, methods are always part of a class (or similar construct).
 * 
 */

/*Functions vs Methods: 
 * In C#, standalone functions don't exist outside of classes. What we typically call "functions" in C# are actually static methods of a class.
 */

/*Classes vs Functions/Methods: 
 * Classes are the overall structure that contains both data (properties) and behavior (methods). Functions and methods define behavior, while classes encompass both data and behavior.

It provides a comprehensive, reusable set of classes, interfaces, and value types that form the foundation for building applications in the .NET ecosystem. The BCL is an essential part of the .NET Framework's Common Language Runtime (CLR) and is also included in the .NET SDK.

Here‚Äôs everything you need to know about the BCL:

1. Definition of Base Class Library (BCL)
BCL is a collection of reusable types, including classes, interfaces, and structures, that developers use to build various types of applications in the .NET ecosystem.
It includes classes for system functionalities like I/O, threading, data access, security, collections, networking, and more.
BCL serves as a foundation for .NET developers, providing common functionality to prevent reinventing the wheel when developing applications.
2. Scope of the BCL
The BCL is a subset of the larger .NET Class Library, which includes additional libraries for application models like ASP.NET, Windows Forms, WPF, Entity Framework, etc.
While the Framework Class Library (FCL) refers to all the libraries provided by .NET, BCL focuses on core functionality that almost any application will need.
BCL is language-neutral, meaning it can be used across any .NET-supported languages like C#, VB.NET, F#, etc.

/*
 * Main Game Flow
Setup: At the start of the game, emojis are randomly placed on TextBlocks in the main grid. The timer begins counting, and the user starts selecting emojis.
Matching Process:
The player clicks an emoji, which becomes hidden.
The player then clicks another emoji.
If they match, both remain hidden, and the game continues.
If they don‚Äôt match, the first emoji is revealed again, and the game continues.
Winning Condition: When the player finds all 8 pairs, the timer stops, and a message appears asking if they want to play again.
 * 
 * */

/*Summary: Key Concepts in Code:
DispatcherTimer: A timer specifically for WPF applications. It operates on the UI thread and is ideal for UI updates.
TextBlock Control: Each TextBlock represents a game tile displaying an emoji. The visibility of the TextBlock is changed based on game logic.
Random Number Generation: Used to shuffle emojis, ensuring that they are placed randomly on the grid.
Grid and Children: The mainGrid is assumed to be a Grid in the XAML that holds TextBlock elements, each representing one of the emoji tiles.
This game showcases simple UI interactions using WPF, combined with basic game logic for matching pairs of items.
